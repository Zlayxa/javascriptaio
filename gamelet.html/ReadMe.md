#Gamelet

Practicing my first JavaScript coding thing. This document is explaining the code and shit without actually being shown on the browser.

##Usage

1. Include gamelet.js in an HTML document containing an element with an ID of 'ball'.

```html
<div id="ball">@</div>
<script src="gamelet.jx" />
```

2. The script will detect when the left or right arrow keys are pressed and will move the ball element accordingly.
